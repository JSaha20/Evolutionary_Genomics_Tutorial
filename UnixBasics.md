## Conda

In bioinformatics you will often need computer programs that are not part of your Unix default installation ...

### Installing conda

Download conda

```
wget https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-py38_23.11.0-2-Linux-x86_64.sh
```

Install miniconda

```
bash https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-py38_23.11.0-2-Linux-x86_64.sh
```
You will be asked to review the license agreement. Press `Enter` to continue. Then `q` to quit the licence agreement. 
Then type `yes` to agree. You will need to type `yes` a few more times throughout the installation. Note: By "typing `yes`, I litterally mean typing the three letters y e s and then pressing `Enter`.

Once miniconda is installed, you need to *quit your terminal and open a new one* to have conda activated.
