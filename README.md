# Evolutionary Genomics Tutorial
A tutorial/assignment on how to get from raw sequencing reads to a basic population genetic analysis.

This tutorial treats the case of short read based whole genome resequencing with an existing reference genome.

It is logical to start with [Alignment and Variant Calling](AlignmentVariantCalling.md). The variant callset produced in this part is then used in [Population Genomics](PopulationGenomics.md) to run some basic population genomic analysis. This tutorial can be run in parallel with the [R plotting tutorial](PlottingPopgenR.md) that shows how to plot the results.
